GHET - Java - Inixia


I did not write this. Inixia wrote this. Inixia does not have a github. 

open IntelliJ
file new project (choose java default)
navigate to src under the project (left hand side)
right click new java class (call it GHET or whatever you want)
copy and paste the contents of GHET.txt here
run it
